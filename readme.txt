This project abstracts the use of NSXMLParser to fetch data within any custom arrangement of XML tags, returning them as an NSArray of NSDictionaries.

There are options to load raw XML from a URL or from NSData. You can parse an NSString of raw XML by converting it to NSData and parsing it.

Declaration information and sample code found in XMLParser.h
